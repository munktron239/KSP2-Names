## KSP2-Names

- One thing that I really liked about KSP2 is that, in addition to its amazing soundtrack, it gave a bit of flair to the stock parts.
- Parts like the Mk1 Command Pod had cute designations such as "Tin Can," and the Mk1-3 pod is the "Gumball."
- And all of the spaceplane cockpits had names based on birds (e.g., the Mk2 inline cockpit is now the "Osprey").
- So I decided to write these simple MM patches to rename some parts in Stock + DLC to match their names in KSP2.

## Dependencies:
- [ModuleManager](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/50533-18x-112x-module-manager-423-july-03th-2023-fireworks-season/)

## Recommendations:
- [Community Parts Titles](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/174189-112-community-parts-titles-2024-07-04/)
Parts names will be adjusted based on whether CPT is installed or not.

## Optional:
If you have some popular mods installed like ReStock+ or Near Future Spacecraft, there is an optional patch that can change the names of some of the modded parts to be like in KSP2, too.

If you don't want this, though, just delete the "modded-parts-OPTIONAL" file, and the parts will go back to their original names that CPT gave them.
